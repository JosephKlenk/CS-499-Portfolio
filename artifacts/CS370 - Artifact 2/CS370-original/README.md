# CS370-Portfolio
I was supplied with start-up files TreasureMaze.py (game environment), GameExperience.py (storage of episodes), and a partially skeletoned Jupyter Notebook. TreasureMaze.py established the maze layout, valid movements, rewards, and game state handling. GameExperience.py supported experience replay to record previous episodes. The notebook had the visualizing functions, neural network structure, and test cases for the game. Within the qtrain function, the deep Q-learning implementation, I coded for the agent initialization, looking at the state, the epsilon-greedy choice of action, experience replay integration, training of the neural network, and performance monitoring in order to reach a 100% win ratio.
# What computer scientists do and why it matters
Computer scientists design algorithms, computational systems, and computational solutions to difficult, impossible, or infeasible problems that would be time-consuming to do by hand. They design artificial intelligence-based systems such as the pirate agent that can acquire optimal behaviors through experience in the way that people do but with mathematical precision. That is important because these solutions can be used to automate challenging tasks, extend human capabilities, and develop new modes of interactions with technology that improve productivity, entertainment, healthcare, and many other fields.
# How I approach problems as a computer scientist
As seen in the project, problem-solving by first grasping the setting and limitations (the maze) and then dissecting the solution into workable pieces (agent, environment, experience replay) works. I apply algorithms (deep Q-learning) that can improve iteratively from data and experience as opposed to hard coding. Abstraction helps to control complexity, evaluate solutions against performance measures (win rate), and tune parameters (epochs, exploration rate) to attain intended outcomes with computational efficiency in mind.
# Ethical responsibilities to end users and organizations
My ethical obligations are to design systems that are trustworthy, equitable, and transparent in their function. In the case of game AI such as the pirate agent, that implies providing difficult-but-beatable opponent action that makes the game more enjoyable, not frustrating. More generally, I need to be aware of potential bias in machine learning algorithms, privacy requirements of data collection, and unforeseen ramifications of autonomous systems. I need to explain the work so that other people can see, extend, and modify it. Last but not least, I ought to be an advocate of reasonable deployment of AI that honors users' autonomy and enterprise principles.
